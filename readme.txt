This project utilizes a combination of Merge Sort and Insertion sort to sort data. Once a certain threshhold is
met, insertion sort is used to sort the data.
The first line of the input file contains fice different integers, the first two being the x and y coordinates
of a person's location, then the third integer being the number of smoothie shops, the fourth being the number 
of points to search for, and the fith being the threshhold number that determines when insertion sort will be
utilized. The next x lines will contain x and y coordinates of shops and the next z lines will be 
x and y coordinates for searching. 

The first x lines of the output file will contain smoothie shops coordinates, with the next z lines containing answer
each of the z queries of input. It will state if a smoothie shop is not found at the specific poits of data.

Note: Use leak detectors in project 1!
